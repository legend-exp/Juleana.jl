One row of the inventory tree.

`kind` is `:production` (the tree root), `:section` (one configured path key),
`:dir`, `:group` (one filekey or one detector tier file, standing for the files that
belong to it), `:file`, `:detectors` (the lazily listed per-detector view of a run
directory) or `:detector` (one top-level HDF5 group of the run's files).

`children === nothing` means "not listed yet", which is different from an empty
directory. `mode` is the mode chosen explicitly on this node; the mode that
actually applies is [`effective_mode`](@ref), which falls back to the ancestors.
